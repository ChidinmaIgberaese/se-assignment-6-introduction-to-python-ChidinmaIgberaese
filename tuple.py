#similar to lists but the only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified

#create a tuple
product = ("Microsoft", "Xbox", "499.99")

#To access element at index 0
print (product[0])

#To access element at index 1
print (product[1])

#To access element at index 0
print (product[2])

coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print(coordinates)
