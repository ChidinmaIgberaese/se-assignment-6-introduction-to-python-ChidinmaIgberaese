# Question 3

Python Syntax and Semantics:

- Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

# Answer

In order to print "Hello, world!" in the console, i opened a file with a dot py extension and named it greetings.py(as seen in my file) and passed a string argument below;

# print ("Hello, world!")

Explanation:
print: A built-in function to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string argument passed to the print function. This is where to insert what should be outputted when triggered.

# Question 4

Data Types and Variables:

- List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

# Answer

Data Types and Variables
Basic Data Types:

1. int: Integer numbers.
2. float: Floating-point numbers.
3. str: String, a sequence of characters.
4. bool: Boolean values (True or False).
5. list: Ordered, mutable collections.
6. tuple: Ordered, immutable collections.
7. dict: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.

# Integer

age = 25
print(age)

# Float

height = 5.9
print(height)

# String

name = "John"
print(name)

# Boolean

is_student = True
print(is_student)

# List

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Tuple

coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print(coordinates)

# Dictionary

person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
print(person)

# Question 5

Control Structures:

- Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

# Answer

Control structures in Python, such as conditional statements and loops, are essential for controlling the flow of a program. They allow you to execute certain code blocks based on specific conditions and to repeat code execution.

Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.

# if-else Statement

An if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

# example of an if-else statement:

age = 18

if age >= 18:
print("You are an adult.")
else:
print("You are a minor.")

# Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The most common loops in Python are for and while loops.

# for Loop

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

# example of a for Loop

for i in range(5):
print(i)

# Question 6

Functions in Python:

- What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

# Answer

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.

# Example of a function:

def add(a, b):
return a + b

# Calling the function

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)

# Question 7

Lists and Dictionaries:

- Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

# Answer

In Python, lists and dictionaries are both data structures used to store collections of items, but they have distinct differences in terms of how they store and access data.

# Lists

Ordered: Lists maintain the order of items.
Indexed: Items in a list are accessed by their index.
Mutable: Lists can be changed after their creation (e.g., items can be added, removed, or modified).
Syntax: Lists are created using square brackets [].

# Example of a List:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionaries

Unordered: Dictionaries do not maintain the order of items.
Key-Value Pairs: Items are stored as key-value pairs.
Mutable: Dictionaries can be changed after their creation (e.g., items can be added, removed, or modified).
Syntax: Dictionaries are created using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.

# Example of a Dictionary:

person = {
"name": "Alice",
"age": 30,
"city": "New York"
}

# Script Demonstrating Basic Operations

# Creating a list of numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Basic operations on the list

print("Original list:", numbers)

# Append an item to the list

numbers.append(6)
print("List after appending 6:", numbers)

# Remove an item from the list

numbers.remove(3)
print("List after removing 3:", numbers)

# Access an item by index

print("Item at index 2:", numbers[2])

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs

person = {
"name": "Alice",
"age": 30,
"city": "New York"
}

# Basic operations on the dictionary

print("\nOriginal dictionary:", person)

# Add a key-value pair to the dictionary

person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print("Dictionary after adding email:", person)

# Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary

del person["age"]
print("Dictionary after removing age:", person)

# Access a value by key

print("Value for key 'name':", person["name"])

# Check if a key exists in the dictionary

print("Is 'city' a key in the dictionary?", "city" in person)

# Output/Result

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
List after appending 6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
List after removing 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
Item at index 2: 4

Original dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
Dictionary after adding email: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
Dictionary after removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
Value for key 'name': Alice
Is 'city' a key in the dictionary? True

# Question 8

Exception Handling:

- What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

# Answer

Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. It allows you to handle errors gracefully, without stopping the program abruptly. This is achieved using try, except, else, and finally blocks.

# Key Components

1. try Block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.
2. except Block: Contains the code that executes if an exception occurs in the try block.
3. else Block: Contains the code that executes if no exception occurs in the try block.
4. finally Block: Contains the code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, often used for cleanup activities.

# example

def read_file(file_path):
try:
file = open(file_path, 'r')
content = file.read()
print(content)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
print(f"Error: {e}. The file was not found.")
except IOError as e:
print(f"Error: {e}. An I/O error occurred.")
else:
print("File read successfully.")
finally:
try:
file.close()
except NameError:
print("File was never opened, no need to close.")
except UnboundLocalError:
print("File variable is not defined, skipping close operation.")
print("Execution of the read_file function is complete.")

# Test cases

read_file("existing_file.txt") # Assuming this file exists
read_file("non_existing_file.txt") # This file does not exist

# Explanation:

try Block:
The try block contains the code that might raise an exception. In this case, it attempts to open and read a file.
except Blocks:

The first except block handles a FileNotFoundError, which occurs if the specified file does not exist. It prints an error message indicating that the file was not found.
The second except block handles an IOError, which occurs if there is an input/output error during the file operation. It prints an error message indicating an I/O error.
else Block:

The else block contains code that executes if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It prints a message indicating that the file was read successfully.
finally Block:

The finally block contains code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. In this case, it attempts to close the file if it was opened successfully.
There are nested try-except blocks within the finally block to handle specific errors related to closing the file. If the file was never opened, it catches NameError. If the file variable is not defined, it catches UnboundLocalError.

# Output

<contents of existing_file.txt>
File read successfully.
Execution of the read_file function is complete.
Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'non_existing_file.txt'. The file was not found.
File was never opened, no need to close.
Execution of the read_file function is complete.

# Question 9

Modules and Packages:

- Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

# Answer

A module is a file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, and variables, which can be imported and used in other Python scripts. Modules help in organizing code into manageable sections and promote code reusability.

# Creating a Module:

Suppose we have a file named my_module.py with the following content:

def greet(name):
return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add(a, b):
return a + b

# We can use this module in another script by importing it:

mypackage/
**init**.py
module1.py
module2.py

mypackage/**init**.py can be empty or contain package initialization code.
mypackage/module1.py and mypackage/module2.py are modules within the package.

# Importing and Using a Module

Module can be imported using the import statement. You can import the whole module or specific functions or variables from the module. The math module is a built-in Python module that provides mathematical functions. Import math

# Example Using the math Module

# use imported function

from math import sqrt
result = sqrt(16)
print(result)

# Explanation

Importing the Module:
import math imports the entire math module.

Using Functions and Constants:
math.sqrt(number) calculates the square root of number.

# Result:

The square root of 16 is 4.0

# Question 10

    File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Answer:

In Python, you can read from and write to files using built-in functions. Here's how you can perform basic file I/O operations:

# Reading from a File

To read the content of a file, you can use the open() function with the 'r' mode (read mode). The read(), readline(), or readlines() methods can then be used to read the file's content.

# Example Script to Read from a File

def read_file(file_path):
try:
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
content = file.read()
print("File content before writing:")
print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
print(f"{file_path} not found. There is nothing to read.")

# Example usage for reading the file

read_file("example1.txt")

# Explanation

open(file_path, 'r'): Opens the file in read mode.
with open(...) as file: Ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.
file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file.
print(content): Prints the file content to the console.
The except blocks handle potential errors, such as the file not being found or other I/O errors.
Reading from example1.txt:

The read_file("example1.txt") function in my example attempts to read "example1.txt".
Since "example1.txt" does not exist, it will print:
example1.txt not found. There is nothing to read.

# Writing to a File

To write to a file, you can use the open() function with the 'w' mode (write mode) or 'a' mode (append mode). The write() or writelines() methods can then be used to write content to the file.

# Example Script to Write to a File

def write_file(file_path, content_to_write):
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
file.write(content_to_write)
print(f"New content written to {file_path}")

# Example usage for writing to the file

content_to_write = "How brilliant that I can write to a file!"
write_file("example2.txt", content_to_write)

# Explanation

open(file_path, 'w'): Opens the file in write mode. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it exists, its content will be overwritten.

# Writing to example2.txt:

The write_file("example2.txt", content_to_write) function will write "How brilliant that I can write to a file!" to "example2.txt". This is because there was no existing content the example2.txt file.

# Combining Both Scripts

Here's a combined script that reads from one file and writes the content to another file:

# Function to read from a file

def read_file(file_path):
try:
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
content = file.read()
print("File content before writing:")
print(content)
return content # Return the content read from the file
except FileNotFoundError:
print(f"{file_path} not found. There is nothing to read.")
return None # Return None if the file does not exist

# Example usage for reading the file

read_content = read_file("example1.txt")

# Function to write to a file

def write_file(file_path, content_to_write):
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
file.write(content_to_write)
print(f"New content written to {file_path}")

# Example usage for writing to the file

content_to_write = "How brilliant that I can write to a file!"
write_file("example2.txt", content_to_write)

# Verify the write operation by reading the file again

if read_content is not None:
read_file("example2.txt")

# Output

example1.txt not found. There is nothing to read.
New content written to example2.txt

# Explanations in the combined script:

These combined Python scripts demonstrate file handling operations. They attempt to read from a non-existent file "example1.txt", handle the FileNotFoundError gracefully, write a specific string "How brilliant that I can write to a file!" to "example2.txt", and confirm the successful write operation with a print statement. The output reflects these operations, indicating the absence of "example1.txt" and the successful creation of "example2.txt" with the specified content.
